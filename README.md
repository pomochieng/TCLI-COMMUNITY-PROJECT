# TCLI-COMMUNITY-PROJECT
Hello.
I am Towunmi Coker, a Medical Doctor and the Founder TCLI an Initiative geared towards effecting needed societal changes
This project is to  build a standard community library in Lagos Nigeria and also create relatable ways on health awareness, TCLI uses stage plays to create a story around common health problems displaying symptoms and signs to look out for and prevention modalities. In Nigeria, not many people benefit from education this is because some are not aware of the value, the few children that desire to are handicapped because of their parentâ€™s financial constraint. TCLI already began to promote reading and writing culture through its annual creative writing among high school students and a creative writing workshop seminars which has helped a lot of students improve their grammar and writing skills, also improving the result of their high school leaving certificates. In the process TCLI realised that some students drop out of school due to inability to purchase books and this prompted the idea for the library as there are not many Libraries in Nigeria. The library will help them with materials for study, research and avenue to receive mentoring from our facilitators. The annual programme has also provided scholarships for a lot of students, reading materials and opportunity for networking with distinguished individuals in the society who mentor these students on the annual ceremony. An example is a young highschool girl who aspired to be a scriptwriter, had the opportunity of networking and receiving mentoring from one of the guest speakers who happened to be an established scriptwriter. What TCLI has been able to achieve in encouraging students to remain in school, get quality education and mentor parents not to force their students into any particular profession but support them as exemplified by the founder who marries her profession as a medical doctor with passion in literature has propelled us to do more. To do more to keep more students in school, provide reading materials, health care services. 
A healthy child is a successful child, hence our interest also in health awareness. Health awareness for the young ones, and for adults in the community. Through the Reading centre/reading hub, students will have the privilege of free health check ups and there will be a sound proof theatre space to stage plays on health awareness monthly. Every month has a unique health awareness scheme and so TCLI would like to leverage on this and create health awareness monthly through stories around this plaguing health problems which people are oblivious to. TCLI achieved over 8000 coverage in 2014 through its stage play to create awareness that women infected with HIV can get married and have children without infecting their spouse. And also, to debunk the myth surrounding stigmatisation.  
TCLI would appreciate support of its program through donations on its gofundme page: https://www.gofundme.com/TCLICampaign, donation of school suppliers and materials and having more people join it in creating awareness.
